        /* Youâ€™re are given a list of pin codes that can be between 3 - 10 numbers.  A PIN code

        * is considered a duplicate of another PIN code if it is in the same or reversed order.

        *

        *  Example:

        *     123 is a duplicate of 123

        *     123 is a duplicate of 321

        *     123 is not a duplicate of 213 or 312, etc

        *

        * Given pin codes 123,213,321, there are a total of 2 distinct pin codes, 123 and 213

        *

        * Write a function that will return the count of distinct PIN codes

        *

        * The ideal time complexity for a solution is O(n)
